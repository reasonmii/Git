★ Use "GitKraken" to visualize the branches

★ Remember these two Merging Concepts:
1) We merge branches, not specific commits
2) We always merge to the current HEAD branch

▶ Basic Step to Merge
1) Switch to or checkout the branch
   you want to merge the changes into (the receiving branch)
2) Use the "git merge" command to merge changes
   from a specific branch into the current branch

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

▶ Fast Forward Merge
Master simply caught up on the commits from the other branch

$ cd Patronus
$ git branch -v
result : * harry  7a2be88 add harry's stag patronus
           lily   1a51cd0 add lily's doe patronus
           master ae321a1 add empty patronus file
$ git switch master
$ git merge harry
result : Updating ae321a1..7a2be88
         Fast-forward
          patronus.txt | 26 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++
          1 file changed, 26 insertions(+)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

▶ Non Fast Forward Merge : git merge <branch-Name>

★ Not All Merges are Fast Forwards!
Imagine one of your teammates merged in a new feature or change to master
while you were working on a branch which is from a previous master version
In such a case, rather than performing a simple fast forward, git performs a "merge commit"

Create new repository and file 'songs.txt'
$ cd desktop
$ mkdir PlaylistTake2
$ cd PlaylistTake2
$ git init
$ touch songs.txt
$ git add songs.txt
$ git commit -m "add songs file"

Add some songs to 'songs.txt'
$ git add songs.txt
$ git commit -m "add 2 ABBA songs"

Create new branch
$ git branch ABBA
$ git switch ABBA

Add some songs to 'songs.txt'
$ git commit -a -m "add Mammamia"

Add some songs to 'songs.txt'
$ git commit -a -m "add dancing queen"

Go back to master branch
$ git switch master

Create new file 'podcasts.txt'
$ touch podcasts.txt
$ git add podcasts.txt
$ git commit -m "add podcasts file"
-> Now master branch has new file
   which ABBA branch does not know about

Add some radio program to 'podcasts.txt'
$ git add podcasts.txt
$ git commit -m "add 3 podcasts"

$ git merge ABBA
result : hint: Waiting for your editor to close the file...
-> It opens visual studio code
-> Just close the file
-> Check 'GitKraken' whether master and ABBA branches are merged
