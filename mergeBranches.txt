※ Git Merge Docs

★ Remember these two Merging Concepts:
1) We merge branches, not specific commits
2) We always merge to the current HEAD branch

▶ Basic Step to Merge
1) Switch to or checkout the branch
   you want to merge the changes into (the receiving branch)
2) Use the "git merge" command to merge changes
   from a specific branch into the current branch

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

▶ Fast Forward Merge
Master simply caught up on the commits from the other branch

$ cd Patronus
$ git branch -v
result : * harry  7a2be88 add harry's stag patronus
           lily   1a51cd0 add lily's doe patronus
           master ae321a1 add empty patronus file
$ git switch master
$ git merge harry
result : Updating ae321a1..7a2be88
         Fast-forward
