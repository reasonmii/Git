▶ Git
Git is the version control software that runs locally on your machine.
You don't need to register for an account.
You don't need the internet to use it.
You can use Git without ever touching Github.

▶ Github
※ https://github.com/
Github is a service that hosts Git repositories in the cloud
and makes it easier to collaborate with other people.
You do need to sign up for an account to use Github.
It's an online place to share work that is done using Git.

▶ Git Clone : git clone <url>
※ https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone
Anyone can clone a repository from Github, provided the repo is public.
You do not need to be an owner or collaborator to clone the repo locally to your machine.
You just need the URL from Github.

When you run the code to clone a repo, 
Git will retrieve all the files associated with the repository
and will copy them to your local machine.
In addition, Git initializes a new repository on your machine,
giving you access to the full Git history of the cloned project.

★ Make sure you are not inside of a repo when you clone!
$ git status
result : fatal: not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git

▶ Non-Github Clone : git clone <url>
We are not limited to Github Repos!
git clone is a standard git command.
It is NOT tied specifically to Github.
We can use it to clone repositories that are hosted anywhere!
It just happens that most of the hosted repos are on Github these days.

$ git clone "https://gitlab.com/gitlab-tests/sample-project"

▶ Github Setup: SSH Config
※ https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh
You need to be authenticated on Github to do certain operations,
like pushing up code from your local machine.
Your terminal will prompt you every single time for your Github email and password,
unless you generate and configure an SSH key!
★ Once configured, you can connect to Github without having to supply your username/password
