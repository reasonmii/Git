▶ README.md
READMEs are "Markdown files", ending with the .md extension
Markdown is a convenient syntax to generate formatted text
It's easy to pick up!

★ If you put a README in the root of your project,
   Github will recognize it and "automatically" display it
   on the repo's home page

● A README file is used to communicate important information
  about a repository including:
- What the project does
- How to run the project
- Why it's noteworthy
- Who maintains the project

★ Markdown reference : https://markdown-it.github.io/
