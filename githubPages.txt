▶ Github Pages
※ https://pages.github.com/
They are public webpages that are hosted and published via Github
They allow you to create a website simply by pushing your code to Github

● static sites
Github Pages is a hosting service for static webpages,
so it does not support server-side code like Python, Ruby, or Node
Just HTML/CSS/JS!

● User Site
You get "one user site" per Github account
This is where you could host a portfolio site or some form of personal website
The default url is based on your Github username, following this pattern:
"username.github.io", though you can change this!

● Project Sites
You get "unlimited" project sites!
Each Github repo can have a corresponding hosted website
It's as simple as telling Github which specific branch contains the web content
The default urls follow this pattern: "username.github.io/repo-name"
